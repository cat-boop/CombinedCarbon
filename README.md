According to nature.org “The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2℃ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.”  (What Is Your Carbon Footprint? | Carbon Footprint Calculator, n.d.) This stat helps us put in perspective how fast the planet is declining. As the public realizes, we know they would need a program that will not only help them keep track of their carbon footprint but also get advice on how to improve it. So that is how we came up with Combined Carbon.

**What it does**
It uses the user input and compares it to the average person's usage in America and using a numeric rating system will give the user a score and help them optimize them optimize their carbon footprint.

**How we built it**
Used basic HTML, CSS, and JS to develop a simple website.

**Challenges we ran into**
Attempted to utilize React to make a proper web app, insufficient knowledge of JS led to us moving to a simpler website. We also wished to implemented AI (some sort of LLM more specifically) to process our data and spit a coherent and readable report to the user that isn't just numbers and jibberish.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
Just proud to be here :D

**What we learned**
Basic Javascript on the fly and how to coordinate a small team.

**What's next for Combined Carbon**
Not sure, maybe we'll complete it if we don't tonight! :prayer_hands:
